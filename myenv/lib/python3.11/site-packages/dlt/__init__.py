"""data load tool (dlt) â€” the open-source Python library for data loading

How to create a data loading pipeline with dlt in 3 seconds:

1. Write a pipeline script
>>> import dlt
>>> from dlt.sources.helpers import requests
>>> dlt.run(requests.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/").json()["results"], destination="duckdb", table_name="pokemon")

2. Run your pipeline script
  > $ python pokemon.py

3. See and query your data with autogenerated Streamlit app
  > $ dlt pipeline dlt_pokemon show

Or start with our pipeline template with sample PokeAPI (pokeapi.co) data loaded to bigquery

  > $ dlt init pokemon bigquery
