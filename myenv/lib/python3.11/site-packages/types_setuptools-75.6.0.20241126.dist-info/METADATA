## Typing stubs for setuptools

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `setuptools`. This version of
`types-setuptools` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`setuptools==75.6.*`.

If using `setuptools >= 71.1` *only* for `pkg_resources`,
you don't need `types-setuptools` since `pkg_resources` is now typed.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/setuptools`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/setuptools)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.13.0,
pyright 1.1.389,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`410081e820b2ec9f17b4d3d2221977563c64407e`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/410081e820b2ec9f17b4d3d2221977563c64407e).
