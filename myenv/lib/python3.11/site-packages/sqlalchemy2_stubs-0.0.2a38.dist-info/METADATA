===========================
SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs (Legacy)
===========================

These are interim PEP-484 typing stubs for the
`SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ **1.4 release series only**. They
are released concurrently along with a
`Mypy extension <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html>`_
which is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the area
of ORM mappings.

The stubs replace the use of the "sqlalchemy-stubs" package published by
Dropbox. Differences include that these stubs are generated against 1.4's API
as well as some adjustments to the use of generics. The sqlalchemy2-stubs stubs
package **will not work with SQLAlchemy 2.0, and will need to be explicitly /
manually uninstalled when upgrading to SQLAlchemy 2.0**.

This project should be considered **alpha level** and is not as mature
as the Dropbox stubs for the initial release.

See the Mypy plugin documentation at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html
for an overview of how to use PEP-484 annotations with ORM mapped classes.

For SQLAlchemy 2.0, when released, **the sqlalchemy2-stubs project is not
compatible**.  SQLAlchemy 2.0 will be / is fully pep-484 typed inline and
will not be compatible with any stubs.  There unfortunately appears to be no
standard approach in Python for the problem of a library that upgrades to
include typing annotations inline, as typing tools will still consider
any installed stubs to take precedence.  Therefore **sqlalchemy2-stubs
will need to be manually uninstalled when upgrading to SQLAlchemy 2.0**.
