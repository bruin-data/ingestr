## Installation

dlt supports Python 3.8+.

```sh
pip install dlt
```

More options: [Install via Conda or Pixi](https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/installation#install-dlt-via-pixi-and-conda)


## Quick Start

Load chess game data from chess.com API and save it in DuckDB:

```python
import dlt
from dlt.sources.helpers import requests

# Create a dlt pipeline that will load
# chess player data to the DuckDB destination
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='chess_pipeline',
    destination='duckdb',
    dataset_name='player_data'
)

# Grab some player data from Chess.com API
data = []
for player in ['magnuscarlsen', 'rpragchess']:
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{player}')
    response.raise_for_status()
    data.append(response.json())

# Extract, normalize, and load the data
pipeline.run(data, table_name='player')
```


Try it out in our **[Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NfSB1DpwbbHX9_t5vlalBTf13utwpMGx?usp=sharing)**

## Features

- **Automatic Schema:** Data structure inspection and schema creation for the destination.
- **Data Normalization:** Consistent and verified data before loading.
- **Seamless Integration:** Colab, AWS Lambda, Airflow, and local environments.
- **Scalable:** Adapts to growing data needs in production.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Clear data pipeline structure for updates.
- **Rapid Exploration:** Quickly explore and gain insights from new data sources.
- **Versatile Usage:** Suitable for ad-hoc exploration to advanced loading infrastructures.
- **Start in Seconds with CLI:** Powerful CLI for managing, deploying and inspecting local pipelines.
- **Incremental Loading:** Load only new or changed data and avoid loading old records again.
- **Open Source:** Free and Apache 2.0 Licensed.

## Ready to use Sources and Destinations

Explore ready to use sources (e.g. Google Sheets) in the [Verified Sources docs](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources) and supported destinations (e.g. DuckDB) in the [Destinations docs](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations).

## Documentation

For detailed usage and configuration, please refer to the [official documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs).

## Examples

You can find examples for various use cases in the [examples](docs/examples) folder.

## Adding as dependency

`dlt` follows the semantic versioning with the [`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#semantic-versioning) pattern.

* `major` means breaking changes and removed deprecations
* `minor` new features, sometimes automatic migrations
* `patch` bug fixes

We suggest that you allow only `patch` level updates automatically:
* Using the [Compatible Release Specifier](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#compatible-release). For example **dlt~=1.0** allows only versions **>=1.0** and less than **<1.1**
* Poetry [caret requirements](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/). For example **^1.0** allows only versions **>=1.0** to **<1.0**
