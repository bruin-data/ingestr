    `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
    represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
    just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
    attached to customers.

    Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).
    We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
    This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method types.

    Related guides: [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) and [Sources & Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/customers).
