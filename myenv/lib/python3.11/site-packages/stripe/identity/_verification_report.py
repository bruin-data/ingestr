    A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
    The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options`
    parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the
    appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.

    Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
    reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)
    API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the
    [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.
