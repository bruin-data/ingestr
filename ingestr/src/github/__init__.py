    This source uses graphql to retrieve all issues (`issues` resource) and pull requests (`pull requests` resource) with the associated reactions (up to 100),

    data for fairly large repos quickly and cheaply.
    You can and should change the queries in `queries.py` to include for example additional fields or connections. The source can be hacked to add more resources for other
    repository nodes easily.
