# Load Data From Personio to DuckDB

Welcome! 👋  
This tutorial will guide you through loading data from `Personio` to `DuckDB` using `ingestr`, a command-line tool that enables data ingestion between any source and destination using simple flags, no coding required.

Personio is human resources management software that helps businesses streamline HR processes, including recruitment and employee data management. To analyze and report on this HR data effectively, you may often need to load it into an analytics database like DuckDB. This is where `ingestr` simplifies the process.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that the following are installed and configured:
- [ingestr](../getting-started/quickstart.md#Installation)
- [Personio API credentials](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/personio#grab-credentials)
- DuckDB

## Ingest Data from Personio to DuckDB
Run the following command to connect to Personio, read from the specified table, and load the data into DuckDB:
```bash
ingestr ingest \
    --source-uri 'personio://?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>' \
    --source-table 'employees' \
    --dest-uri 'duckdb:///personio.duckdb' \
    --dest-table 'dest.employees'
```
- `--source-uri`: Connects to your data source.  
  Example: `personio://?client_id=<ID>&client_secret=<SECRET>`  
  This specifies the data source (Personio) and uses API credentials (client_id and client_secret) to authenticate with the Personio account.

- `--source-table`: Specifies the table from which to read data.  
  In the above example, the `employees` table in Personio is selected, retrieving employee information.

- `--dest-uri`: Connects to your destination, specifying where the data will be stored.

- `--dest-table`: Defines the table in DuckDB where the data will be stored.  
  Example: `'dest.employees'`  
  This stores the data in the `employees` table within the `dest` schema in DuckDB

## Verify the Data in DuckDB
After running the above command with valid credentials, your `Personio` data will be successfully loaded into `DuckDB`. Here's what the data looks like in the destination:

🎉 Congratulations!   
You've successfully loaded data from Personio to your desired destination.
