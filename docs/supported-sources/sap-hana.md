# SAP HANA
SAP HANA is an in-memory, column-oriented, relational database management system.

ingestr supports SAP HANA as both a source and destination. It uses the [SQLAlchemy connector for SAP Hana](https://github.com/SAP/sqlalchemy-hana/), so the connection options there would all be valid.

## URI Format
The URI format for SAP HANA is as follows:

```plaintext
hana://user:password@host:port/dbname
```

URI parameters:
- `user`: the username to connect to the database
- `password`: the password for the user
- `host`: the host address of the database server
- `port`: the port number the database server is listening on (default is 30015)
- `dbname`: the name of the database to connect to

The URI structure can be used both for sources and destinations. More details about SAP HANAâ€™s JDBC and ODBC interfaces can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/sqlalchemy-hana/).
