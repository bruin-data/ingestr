# Docebo

[Docebo](https://www.docebo.com/) is a cloud-based Learning Management System (LMS) platform that provides enterprise learning solutions for employee training, customer education, and partner enablement.

ingestr supports Docebo as a source.

## URI format

The URI format for Docebo is as follows:

```plaintext
docebo://?base_url=<base_url>&client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&username=<username>&password=<password>
```

URI parameters:
- `base_url`: the base URL of your Docebo instance (e.g., `https://yourcompany.docebosaas.com`)
- `client_id`: OAuth2 client ID for API authentication
- `client_secret`: OAuth2 client secret for API authentication
- `username`: (optional) username for password grant type authentication
- `password`: (optional) password for password grant type authentication

## Setting up a Docebo Integration

To obtain your Docebo API credentials:

1. Log in to your Docebo platform as a Super Admin
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **API and SSO**
3. Create a new OAuth2 application
4. Note the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Configure the appropriate scopes for your integration needs

You can use either:
- **Client Credentials Grant**: Use only `client_id` and `client_secret` (recommended for server-to-server integrations)
- **Password Grant**: Include `username` and `password` along with client credentials (for user-specific access)

Here's a sample command that will copy data from Docebo into a DuckDB database:

```bash
ingestr ingest \
--source-uri 'docebo://?base_url=https://yourcompany.docebosaas.com&client_id=your_client_id&client_secret=your_client_secret' \
--source-table 'users' \
--dest-uri duckdb:///docebo.duckdb \
--dest-table 'dest.users'
```
