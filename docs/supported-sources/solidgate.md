```

## Setting up a Solidgate Integration

Solidgate requires a few steps to set up an integration. Please follow the [guide](https://docs.solidgate.com/payments/integrate/access-to-api/#retrieve-your-credentials).

Once you complete the guide, you should have `public_key` and `secret_key`, hereâ€™s a sample command that ingests data from Solidgate into a DuckDB database:

```sh
ingestr ingestr ingest \
--source-uri "solidgate://?public_key=api_pk_test&secret_key=api_sk_test" \
--source-table "apm-orders" \
--dest-uri "duckdb:///solidgate.db" \
--dest-table "dest.apmorders"
```

The result of this command will be a table in the `Solidgate.duckdb` database with JSON columns.

## Tables

Solidgate source allows ingesting the following sources into separate tables:
- `subscriptions`: Provides a comprehensive view of customer subscriptions, including subscription IDs, statuses, and key timestamps such as creation, update, and expiration dates.
- `apm_orders`: Provides essential information for anti-fraud purposes, including order IDs, transaction statuses, amounts, currencies, and payment methods, along with crucial customer details such as email addresses.
- `card_orders`: Provides detailed information on orders processed via card payments, including transaction data, payment status, and customer details.
- `financial_entries`: Provides a detailed transaction-level breakdown of financial records.

Use these as `--source-table` parameter in the `ingestr ingest` command.
