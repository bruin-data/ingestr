# S3

[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a bucket for storing data in Amazon's Simple Storage Service, a cloud-based storage solution provided by AWS. S3 buckets allow users to store and retrieve data at any time from anywhere on the web.

ingestr supports S3 as a source.

## URI format

The URI format for S3 is as follows:

```plaintext
s3://?access_key_id=<access_key_id>&secret_access_key=<secret_access_key>
```

URI parameters:

- `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` : Used for accessing S3 bucket.

The `--source-table` must be in the format:
```
{bucket name}/{file glob}
```

## Setting up a S3 Integration

S3 requires an `access_key_id` and a `secret_access_key` to access the bucket. Please follow the guide on dltHub to [obtain credentials](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/filesystem/basic#get-credentials). Once you've completed the guide, you should have an `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`. From the S3 URI, you can extract the `bucket_name` and `path_to_files`

For example, if your `access_key_id` is `AKC3YOW7E`, `secret_access_key` is `XCtkpL5B`, bucket name is `my_bucket`, and `path_to_files` is `students/students_details.csv`, here's a sample command that will copy the data from the S3 bucket into a DuckDB database:

```sh
ingestr ingest \
    --source-uri 's3://?access_key_id=AKC3YOW7E&secret_access_key=XCtkpL5B' \
    --source-table 'my_bucket/students/students_details.csv' \
    --dest-uri duckdb:///s3.duckdb \
    --dest-table 'dest.students_details'
```

The result of this command will be a table in the DuckDB database in the path `s3.duckdb`.

Below are some examples of path patterns, each path pattern is a glob you can specify after the bucket name:

- `**/*.csv`: Retrieves all the CSV files, regardless of how deep they are within the folder structure.
- `*.csv`: Retrieves all the CSV files from the first level of a folder.
- `myFolder/**/*.jsonl`: Retrieves all the JSONL files from anywhere under `myFolder`.
- `myFolder/mySubFolder/users.parquet`: Retrieves the `users.parquet` file from `mySubFolder`.
- `employees.jsonl`: Retrieves the `employees.jsonl` file from the root level of the bucket.
