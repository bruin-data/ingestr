[Monday.com](https://monday.com/) is a Work OS that powers teams to run projects and workflows with confidence. It's a simple, yet powerful platform that enables people to manage work, meet deadlines, and build a culture of transparency.

## URI format

The URI format for Monday.com is as follows:

```

URI parameters:
- `api_token` is your Monday.com API token for authentication.

## Setting up a Monday.com Integration

You can obtain an API token from the [Monday.com Developer Console](https://developer.monday.com/). For more information, see [Monday.com authentication documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/authentication).

You can run the following to achieve this:
```sh
ingestr ingest \
  --source-uri "monday://?api_token=fake_token" \
  --source-table "boards" \
  --dest-uri "duckdb://./monday.db" \
  --dest-table "public.boards"
```
